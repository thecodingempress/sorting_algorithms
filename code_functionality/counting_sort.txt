int get_max(int *array, int size)

1. The function get_max() takes two arguments: an array of integers and the size of the array.
2. The function initializes a variable max to the first element of the array.
3. The for loop iterates over the array, comparing each element to max. If the element is greater than max, max is set to the element.
4. The function returns the value of max.

void counting_sort(int *array, size_t size)

1. First, we create a count array of size max + 1.
2. Then, we iterate through the input array and count the number of times each element appears.
3. Then, we iterate through the count array and add the count of each element to the previous element.
4. Finally, we iterate through the input array and place each element in the sorted array at the index equal to the count of that element.
